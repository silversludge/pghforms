# pghforms - clerkship is hell

#### What is this?
A repository of Jib's side project to bring PGH forms to the 21st century.

#### Who made this?
Jibreel Fernandez of UPCM Class 2021. Currently in Learning Unit 6 (Clerkship).

#### But why tho?
Because clerkship is _hell_ and request forms take up _too_ much time to write.

#### But you have time to make this?
Bitch, shut up.

#### Is this an official PGH document?
No. And I detach myself from all attribution. Please use at your own risk.

#### Can you make...
**No.** :)
